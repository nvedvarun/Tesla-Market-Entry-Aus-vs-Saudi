# Australia vs. Saudi Arabia Tesla Market Entry Case Study  

## Overview
This project evaluates Tesla’s market-entry potential in **Australia vs. Saudi Arabia**, based on EV readiness, regulation, infrastructure maturity, financial ROI, and long-term strategic value. This was part of an 48-hour interview assessment for an Analyst role under the Regulatory Credit Trading team at Tesla. The prompt was just a two-liner asking "whether to enter the Saudi Arabian or Australian automotive market first" without any resources/data.

**Deliverables included:**
- A structured **PowerPoint strategy deck** comparing both markets  
- An **Excel financial model** (TAM sizing, scenarios, revenue streams, profitability)  

## Thought Process

My goal going into this case was to ground my assumptions in real world data, while building a recommendation that connects **market insight and financial impact**. This meant finding actionable information from trusted government data sources and using Tesla's 10-K financial reports to bridge gaps while building the financial model. 

There was also a special focus on the revenue generated from regulatory credit trading *(i.e in certain countries/regions Tesla gains credits for selling EV vehicles and these credits can be sold to other automotive companies to offset their non-EV vehicle production)* as that was the team I was interviewing with.

### 1. Starting with the core question  
Before doing any modeling, I broke the prompt into two anchor questions:
- *Where can Tesla scale faster with lower execution risk?*  
- *Which market generates stronger economics per unit and per credit?*

This helped frame the analysis around **speed of adoption**, **policy incentives**, and **financial return**, rather than just raw market size.

### 2. Understanding the macro backdrop  
- **Australia** already has high EV penetration growth, detailed policies, and near-term NVES credit rules.
- **Saudi Arabia** has strong long-term ambitions but more uncertainty in the near term.

### 3. Building the EV market forecasts  
- Using historical sales from reports (EV Council, IEA, etc.)
- Applying **CAGR and policy-driven step-ups** (e.g., 50% by 2030 mandate in Australia)
- Adjusting Saudi Arabia with more conservative adoption curves

### 4. Estimating Tesla’s market share  
Since assumption was Tesla does not operate in either market today, I used:
- Benchmarks from similar “late entry” markets (e.g., EU countries share patterns)
- Competitive landscape intensity
- Policy friendliness toward foreign OEMs
- Tariff structures

This led to:
- **Lower share in Australia** due to heavy competition  
- **Higher potential share in Saudi Arabia** if policy remains neutral  

This balance was important because raw TAM alone does not determine revenue.

### 5. Translating market share into revenue  
Using Tesla’s 2024 10-K:
- Revenue per vehicle  
- Cost per vehicle  
- SG&A as a % of revenue  
- Regulatory credit revenue (modeled at 2.9% of vehicle sales)

I modeled:
- Inflation  
- Tariffs (15% in Saudi, partly absorbed by Tesla)  
- Ramp curves  

This created clean annual net income projections for each market.

### 6. Evaluating policy and AV strategy  
Beyond the numbers, I layered in:
- **Australia’s NVES credit monetization**, which materially boosts profitability  
- **Australia’s clearer AV regulatory roadmap**  
- **Saudi’s dependence on future promises under Vision 2030**  
- **Cultural reliance on private vehicles (Saudi) vs. public transport alternatives (Australia)**  

This ensured my recommendation wasn’t purely financial while accounting for Tesla’s forward-looking AV strategy.

### 7. Testing sensitivities  
I tested scenarios using variance analysis by adjusting:
- Market share ±5%  
- Cost per vehicle  
- Tariff absorption  
- Credit revenue multiples  

Across all cases, **Australia led in net income until 2033**, confirming robustness in the recommendation.

## Conclusion
Recommendation: Enter **Australia** first and **Saudi Arabia** later on when market foundations and policies mature.

Australia showed:
- Stronger EV adoption momentum  
- More mature charging & regulatory environment  
- Lower execution risk and faster path to profitability  

Saudi Arabia presents long-term potential but requires larger upfront investment and offers slower initial demand. This sequencing allows Tesla to maximize profitability now while positioning for long-term strategic expansion.
